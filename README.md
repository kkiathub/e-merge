# E-merge App

This full-stack app allows you search any kind of product on sale and for your own convenience. A user authentication system has been set up so anytime you come back to our app, you will be able to retrieve information from past searches.

  We have added a shopping cart option for you to use and save a product you may have liked. With our shipping calculating system, you will be able to work around those products you have added to your profile page and get an acccurate estimated cost based on weight and size.
